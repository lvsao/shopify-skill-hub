# Public Data Extraction — No-API Mode

Use this reference when the merchant chooses Path C (public_storefront) and provides only a store domain or product URL. This guide explains how to extract every available product field using Shopify's built-in public JSON endpoints and HTML scraping, so the full audit report can still be generated despite having zero API permissions.

## Overview

When the merchant gives a product URL instead of API credentials:

```text
Shopify Admin API fields available:   ~18 fields
Public JSON + HTML fields available:  ~16 fields (89%)
Fields requiring Admin API:           2 fields (metafields, metafieldDefinitions)
```

The two missing fields affect only the Metafield Audit module in the report. All other modules (title, description, SEO title, meta description, images, alt text, evidence, micro-intents, enhanced snippets, blog map, community) can be produced from public data.

## Step-by-Step: Extract Data from a Product URL

### 1. Parse the URL

Given a URL like `https://www.your-store.com/collections/dog-harnesses/products/flora-dog-walking-set`:

```javascript
const url = new URL(userUrl);
const storeDomain = url.hostname;                              // "www.your-store.com"
const pathParts = url.pathname.split("/").filter(Boolean);
const productsIndex = pathParts.indexOf("products");
const handle = productsIndex !== -1 ? pathParts[productsIndex + 1] : null;  // "flora-dog-walking-set"
```

Then resolve the store domain to `.myshopify.com` (same method as Path B):
- If `storeDomain` ends with `.myshopify.com`, use directly
- If it is `admin.shopify.com/store/<name>`, extract to `<name>.myshopify.com`
- Otherwise, fetch the storefront HTML and extract `Shopify.shop = "..."`

### 2. Fetch Product JSON (Primary Source)

```
GET https://{store-domain}/products/{handle}.json
```

No headers needed. Returns:

| JSON Key | Maps To | Used For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `title` | Product title | Asset title score, recommended title |
| `body_html` | Product description (full HTML) | Asset description score, recommended description |
| `vendor` | Brand | Evidence context |
| `product_type` | Category | Intent classification |
| `tags` | Comma-separated tags | Evidence, context |
| `handle` | URL slug | Constructing product URL |
| `variants[].title` | Variant name (Size/Color) | Pricing context |
| `variants[].price` | Variant price | Pricing context |
| `variants[].sku` | SKU | Inventory context |
| `variants[].inventory_quantity` | Stock count | Opportunity signal |
| `variants[].available_for_sale` | Availability | Exclusion signal |
| `images[].src` | Full CDN image URL | Download for vision analysis |
| `images[].alt` | Existing alt text | Alt text audit, score |
| `images[].width` | Image width | Image metadata |
| `images[].height` | Image height | Image metadata |
| `options[].name` | Option name (Size, Color) | Variant structure |
| `options[].values` | Option values | Variant structure |
| `published_at` | Publication timestamp | Default: assume active |

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "product": {
    "id": 1234567890,
    "title": "Vetreska Flora Dog Harness with backpack & Collar & Lead 3-in-One Set",
    "body_html": "<p>Take your pet's style to the next level...</p>",
    "vendor": "Vetreska",
    "product_type": "Dog Walking Sets",
    "handle": "flora-dog-walking-set",
    "tags": "",
    "published_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00-05:00",
    "variants": [
      {
        "id": 9876543210,
        "title": "XS",
        "price": "59.99",
        "sku": "FLORA-XS",
        "inventory_quantity": 15,
        "available_for_sale": true
      }
    ],
    "images": [
      {
        "id": 1111111111,
        "alt": "Vetreska Flora 3-in-1 Dog Walking Set in Pink",
        "src": "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/.../image.jpg",
        "width": 2048,
        "height": 2048
      }
    ],
    "options": [
      { "name": "Size", "values": ["XS", "S", "M", "L"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Fetch Product Page HTML (SEO Fields)

```
GET https://{store-domain}/products/{handle}
```

Parse the HTML `<head>` for SEO fields:

```javascript
// Extract from raw HTML
const titleMatch = html.match(/<title>([^<]*)<\/title>/i);
const metaDescMatch = html.match(/<meta\s+name="description"\s+content="([^"]*)"/i);
const canonicalMatch = html.match(/<link\s+rel="canonical"\s+href="([^"]*)"/i);
const ogTitleMatch = html.match(/<meta\s+property="og:title"\s+content="([^"]*)"/i);
const ogDescMatch = html.match(/<meta\s+property="og:description"\s+content="([^"]*)"/i);
const ogImageMatch = html.match(/<meta\s+property="og:image"\s+content="([^"]*)"/i);

const effectiveSeoTitle = titleMatch ? titleMatch[1].trim() : "";
const effectiveMetaDescription = metaDescMatch ? metaDescMatch[1].trim() : "";
const onlineStoreUrl = canonicalMatch ? canonicalMatch[1] : `${domain}/products/${handle}`;
```

**Important: Shopify SEO Fallback Rule**

The `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags always show the **effective** value after Shopify's fallback rules are applied:

| Shopify Admin Field | If Empty | Effective HTML Shows | Our Detection |
|-------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| `seo.title` | Falls back to `product.title` | Product title as `<title>` | Cannot distinguish; use `source: "public_html"` |
| `seo.description` | Falls back to first 155 chars of `product.description` | Truncated description as `<meta>` | Cannot distinguish; use `source: "public_html"` |

**Do NOT claim the merchant has custom SEO fields or is using fallbacks** — the HTML alone cannot tell us which case applies. Mark all SEO field sources as `"public_html_effective"`.

### 4. Scan All Products (for batch planning)

```
GET https://{store-domain}/products.json?limit=250&page=1
```

Pagination: increment `page=N` until the response `products` array is empty.

Note: The list endpoint returns product objects **without** `body_html`. You need the individual product JSON for full description data. Use the list endpoint only for scanning and opportunity scoring.

```javascript
async function scanAllProducts(domain) {
  const products = [];
  let page = 1;
  while (true) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://${domain}/products.json?limit=250&page=${page}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    if (!data.products || data.products.length === 0) break;
    products.push(...data.products);
    page++;
  }
  return products;
}
```

### 5. Fetch Collection Data (for narrowing)

```
GET https://{store-domain}/collections.json
```

Returns list of collections with `handle`, `title`, `products_count`.

```
GET https://{store-domain}/collections/{handle}/products.json?limit=250
```

Returns products within that collection (same format as `/products.json`).

## Public Mode Limitations in the Report

When generating the audit report in Path C, apply these adjustments:

### Metafields Audit Module
- Skip entirely. The report should show:
  ```text
  "Metafield audit requires Admin API access (Path A or B). Not available in public mode."
  ```

### SEO Title / Meta Description Source Labels
- Use `"public_html_effective"` as the source label for both fields.
- Show this note in the report:
  ```text
  "SEO title and meta description values were extracted from the page HTML. The skill cannot determine whether these are custom SEO fields or Shopify default fallbacks — they are shown as-is."
  ```

### Opportunity Scoring Adjustments
- Remove points for "custom SEO field missing" (we cannot detect this).
- Keep points for weak effective SEO title / meta description (we can still score the content).
- Skip `onlineStoreUrl` check — construct URL from domain + handle instead.
- Skip `status` check — assume active if `published_at` is set and the JSON returned successfully.

### Product Status
- If `published_at` is present and non-null, assume product is active.
- If `published_at` is null or missing, warn: "Product status unknown (public mode); treat as draft/unpublished."

## Image Download for Vision Analysis

All image URLs from the public JSON are Shopify CDN URLs that require no authentication:

```
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/{shop_id}/files/{filename}
```

You can:
1. Download each image to a temp directory using `fetch` or `curl`
2. Open the image through the host environment's image input pathway
3. Generate alt text from actual pixel evidence (mark source as `"vision"`)
4. Fall back to context-only alt text if vision is unavailable

No API scope needed — the CDN is public.

## Public Mode Validation Checklist

Before declaring data extraction complete:

- [ ] Store domain resolved to `.myshopify.com`
- [ ] Product handle extracted from URL
- [ ] `/products/{handle}.json` returned 200 with valid product object
- [ ] `body_html` present and non-empty (descriptions may be HTML)
- [ ] Product page HTML fetched and parsed for `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`
- [ ] CDN image URLs extracted for any vision-based alt text analysis
- [ ] If scanning: `/products.json` pagination works (no blocking)
- [ ] If the store blocks public JSON (403/Cloudflare/etc.), inform the user and suggest Path A or B

## Fallback if Public Access Is Blocked

Some Shopify stores block `/products.json` and/or `/products/{handle}.json` via:

- Cloudflare bot protection
- Akamai / edge security
- Custom reverse proxy

If the JSON endpoint returns 403, 404, or a non-JSON response after 3 retries:

1. Inform the user: "Your store's public endpoints appear to be blocked by security measures. The skill needs either API access (Path A or B) or storefront JSON access."
2. Suggest the user try a product URL instead of store domain (some stores block JSON on store root but allow it on product pages).
3. If still blocked, recommend switching to Path A or Path B.
4. Do not fall back to full HTML scraping — raw HTML parsing is unreliable for product description, variants, and images.
