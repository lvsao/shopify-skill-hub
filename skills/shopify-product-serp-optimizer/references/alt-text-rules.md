# Product Media Alt Text Rules

Use this reference when generating or reviewing product image alt text inside `shopify-product-serp-optimizer`.

## Scope

This skill updates only product media alt text.

- Generate and review alt text inside this skill.
- Include approved alt text in the same product execution bundle as title, description, SEO title, and meta description when relevant.
- Do not route product alt text work to another skill as the default path.

## Length

- Shopify allows image alt text up to 512 characters, but target 60-120 characters.
- Keep 125 characters or fewer by default.
- Never submit alt text longer than 512 characters.
- Rewrite overlong alt text into a shorter complete phrase instead of truncating mid-sentence.

## Quality

Write concise, truthful descriptions of what is visibly in the image and why it matters in the product context.

Prefer:

- `Black leather tote bag with gold zipper and shoulder straps on a white background`
- `Laptop backpack with padded device sleeve and front organizer pocket beside a suitcase handle`
- `Stainless steel water bottle with screw-top lid shown in hand for size context`

Avoid:

- Keyword lists.
- Repeating the same product title for every image.
- `image of`, `picture of`, or `photo of` unless the medium itself matters.
- Claims not visible in the image or supported by merchant product context.
- Decorative details that do not help a shopper or screen-reader user.

## Visual-Evidence Rule

Do not claim `source: "vision"` unless the agent actually inspected pixels during the current run.

Required path for `source: "vision"`:

1. Download only the current product-image batch to an operating-system temp directory.
2. Open the local image through the host environment's real image-input pathway.
3. Record at least three pixel-derived facts.
4. Generate the final alt text from those pixel facts plus merchant context.

Downloading a file is not image inspection. Filenames, URLs, surrounding text, and product titles are not pixel evidence.

## Context-Only Fallback

When direct image inspection is unavailable, generate a lower-confidence candidate only from merchant product context:

- product title
- product type
- vendor
- tags
- options and variants
- product description
- media position
- image filename or URL slug

For context-only candidates:

- Mark `source` as `context_only`.
- Mark confidence conservatively.
- Do not invent color, material, angle, packaging, dimensions, or scene details that were not visible or explicitly stated in merchant product data.
- Apply only after explicit user approval of the exact candidate.

## Duplicate Control

Within the same product:

- Do not reuse the exact same alt text across images.
- If two candidates differ only by punctuation or generic filler, treat them as duplicates.
- Distinguish images only with grounded differences such as color, angle, open/closed state, packaging, scale reference, lifestyle scene, or feature close-up.
- If uniqueness cannot be achieved without guessing, keep the wording conservative and flag the item for review.

## Shared-File Awareness

- Product media alt text is updated through `fileUpdate`.
- If a file may be shared across product references, warn about shared-file impact before execution.

## Final Gate

Before approval preview:

- Reject alt text above 512 characters.
- Rewrite alt text above 125 characters unless accessibility clearly requires more detail.
- Reject unsupported claims.
- Reject any `vision` candidate without concrete visual evidence.
- Keep product alt text inside the same approval bundle as other product-field changes when the user wants one-round execution.
